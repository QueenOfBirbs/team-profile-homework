---USER STORY---
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

---ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA---
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated

---NOTES---
So I got super confused on this one tbh.
We've worked on many aspects of this kinda stuff but done different ways so I wasn't really sure what the correct method was.
Or how to combine said learned concepts together so it would do what it was asked.
I messed around with it for a bit but I wasn't sure if I was allowed to add files or just work with the given ones?
Which just made everything even more confusing since it didn't have some require files for a method.
So yeah, there's not much in here lol. I'm definitely gonna study more on this stuff.
